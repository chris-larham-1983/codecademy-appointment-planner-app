## General Information

This is my solution to the **Codecademy** portfolio project entitled *Appointment Planner*, wherein I had to design 
a **React app** that allows users to add contacts and appointments to an appointment planner.

This app met the following project requirements:

- allow users to create contacts
- allow users to create appointments
- notify the user if a contact already exists in the contacts list

I also added the ability for users to delete contacts and appointments.

***

## Technologies
  
I wrote this **React app** primarily using *ReactJS* and *JSX*.  I also modified the *CSS* in *index.css* in order to 
improve the app's appearance.
